First of all, this is my first mod made for a personal need. I don't like having multiple mods that unlock 1 thing and I prefer an all in one. It may be out of balance or undergo changes since I want it to be balanced.

This mod allows you to manufacture most of the items locked in Rimworld and Royalty (not Archotech), grouping all those items in one mod instead of several.

Add several investigations using the techprint system and requiring a medium-high amount of investigation to unlock the technologies necessary for the creation of the items.

Many of the items are balanced with respect to the MV(Market Value) and the amount of work, techprint have custom MV and they are expensive. For example: resurrector serum need 5 techprint and each techprint cost 10.000 silver plus 30.000 research point and need 3.000 points of work to make (cataphract armor have 1.000, reference).

![FAQ](https://i.imgur.com/Fpg70LW.png)

Q: Is this mod compatible with Combat Extended?<br />
A: I play with Combat Extended so yeah.

Q: Is this mod save game compatible?<br />
A: Yes, It's simple XML mod.

Q: Is it compatible with X mod?<br />
A: Should be, I play with 300+ moids and 0 problems.

Q: Why X item are not included?<br />
A: I try not unbalanced the game (not much) and do things with logic. Items from Empire, Glitterworld or human society will surely add but ancient or archotech items not because they aren't supposed to be within human knowledge (Rimworld lore).

Q: Will you add items/equipment from others mods?<br />
A: Most likely, it may be from Vanilla Series.
